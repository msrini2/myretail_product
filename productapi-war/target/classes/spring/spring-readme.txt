Guidelines to use spring bean definition files for Offers API, eCoupon API, etc:
- Root application context is located in current folder (offersapi-war/src/main/resources/spring/applicationContext.xml)
- Additional project-specific spring bean definitions (xml files) are located in respective projects in offersapi-*/src/main/resources/spring/ folder
-- example: offersapi-dao/src/main/resources/spring/applicationContext-dao.xml
- Additional context configurations are imported to applicationContext.xml using classpath
-- example: <import resource="classpath:spring/applicationContext-dao.xml" />
- Follow best practices to naming conventions for spring configuration files (applicationContext-something.xml)
- If you have Spring Profile dependency, create Spring Profile specific files, each per Profile, place to offersapi-*/src/main/resources/spring/profiles/ folder
-- example: offersapi-war/src/main/resources/spring/profiles/applicationContext-local.xml
- If you have Maven Profile dependency (build dependency), create build specific files in respective projects in offersapi-*/src/main/resources/spring/build/ folder
-- example: offersapi-batch/src/main/resources/spring/build/applicationContext-batch.xml
- Always create unique name of any spring bean definition file across all projects and dependencies of Offers API, eCoupon API, OfferBatch API, etc
